#Welcome to imgDropper

[imgDropper](http://www.imgdropper.com) is a Rails based web app that allows the user to easily upload and share images.

##Easily upload images
* Choose a file from your computer, paste a url, or just drag and drop your image file onto the page for easy uploading.

* Users do not have to be logged in to upload an image, only if they want to keep track of their images and have the ability to edit or delete.

##Instantly receive links to send to your friends
* Once you upload a picture, links are provided for the image's page as well as a direct link to the image file itself.

* HTML embed code is provided for you to paste into your website as well.

##See popular posts
* The front page displays all of the most popular images on the site at the moment.

* Upvote and Downvote images.

##Discuss the images with others
